Israel: Confirmed COVID-19 cases by age group â€“ indexed to the start of the vaccination
campaign

Israel has conducted the fastest campaign to vaccinate its population against COVID-19 so far. The world is now watching how the pandemic in the country evolves to assess whether vaccinations are having the intended effect, and how effective they might be in preventing infection, severe disease and death.

To answer the question of how the vaccination campaign impacts the evolution of COVID-19 requires a thorough analysis based on an epidemiological model. All we can do here is to present some relevant data to track what is happening. Note that the changes in case rates, hospitalizations and deaths cannot be solely attributed to the impact of vaccination.

To be able to track the development of the pandemic in Israel, we show the data on vaccinations, confirmed cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths in the following charts. The data presented below comes from multiple sources:

Data on vaccinations, confirmed cases, and hospitalizations by age and by geographical group (early or late vaccination) comes from the work of Hagai Rossman, Smadar Shilo, Tomer Meir, Malka Gorfine, Uri Shalit, and Eran Segal.1 Their preprint paper can be found here. This data will be updated every few days.
Data on total vaccinations (from our global dataset on vaccinations) and confirmed cases and deaths (from Johns Hopkins University) is updated daily.
Data on confirmed cases by age group, and on hospitalizations and ICU admissions, comes from the Israeli government and is updated weekly.

Our data on confirmed COVID-19 cases in Israel is imported from the official website of the Israeli government, which makes available a set of files on COVID-19 statistics in open access. This data is updated weekly.
